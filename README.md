# HodorFuzzer
Fellow Hodors,

This is a Fuzzer which scans ports at a target web address to look for open web services, and reports its findings to the console. 
It does so by sending HTTP requests to a sequence of ports at the target.

This program was developed using Python 2.7.9, but will likely run with any version of Python in the 2.6+ family.It can either scan all ports (65535) or the ports you specify in a ports.txt file. 

An example ports.txt is provided in this directory. 
The system expects ports to be in the format of one-per-line like this: 
8888 
21 
22 
122

EXAMPLE USAGE: 

WITH WORDLIST: python fuzzer.py -ports ports.txt -target http://so-hodor.org -throttle 20 -timeout 2â€¨

WITHOUT WORDLIST: python fuzzer.py -target http://so-hodor.org -throttle 20 -timeout 2-ports 

The file name in this directory containing the ports you want to try. This is optional, and if you omit this parameter the system will scan all possible ports.

-target The target URL to investigate, in the format: http://so-hodor.org -- remember to omit any trailing slash.
-throttle The target throttle, which is the maximum number of requests to the server that are allowed to occur a 1 second time window. -timeout The timeout period, in seconds, after which we consider an attempt on a target port to have failed.

Each output is fairly self-explanitory. 

The TITLE field is the title tag of any web-pages that are being served on the target at the specified port. The NOTES field shows some further information about the connection attempt, in case this is important or interesting.
